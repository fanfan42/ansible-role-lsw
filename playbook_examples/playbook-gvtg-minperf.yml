# The minperf playbook stands for "minimal performance"
# The Windows VM is on an image file with no disk dedicated to the VM. It gives decent performance.
# Please take your time to adjust the size for "pgs_windows_img_size" you can give to your image depending
# on the size you have on your only disk.
# Note: Looking Glass musts be installed because it's a requirement for this virtualization mode. 
# Adjust the variables with documentation/VARIABLES.md
