# The maxperf playbook stands for "maximum performance"
# The Windows VM is on a dedicated disk for the VM with passthrough PCI controller.
# lsw_windows_img_size don't have to be too high. You will expand your drive directly on Windows after installation.
# It gives you a dual boot system with Windows and Linux at boot.
# lsw_windows_install_template is set to private mode for performance but less security and no Microsoft EULA support.
# lsw_windows_install_template set to private should only be used for private or educational purpose. Use at your own risks.
# You have to find the path of your lsw_config_usb_kbd and lsw_config_usb_mouse to have low latency on these devices.
# Note: lsw_config_usb_kbd and lsw_config_usb_mouse wont work on Linux host
# It gives maximum performance.
# Ninite programs are also installed.
# Adjust the variables with documentation/VARIABLES.md.
# Note 1: Windows 10 has still better performance than Windows 11 but support may end in October 2025.
# Note 2: Looking Glass musts be installed because it's a requirement for this virtualization mode.
