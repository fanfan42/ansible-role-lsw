# The medperf playbook stands for "medium performance"
# The Windows VM is on a dedicated disk for the VM but the PCI controller is "emulated".
# pgs_windows_img_size don't have to be too high. You will expand your drive directly on Windows after installation.
# It gives you a dual boot system with Windows and Linux at boot.
# It gives good performance.
# Note: Looking Glass musts be installed because it's a requirement for this virtualization mode. 
# Ninite programs are also installed.
# Adjust the variables with documentation/VARIABLES.md
