# The minperf playbook stands for "minimal performance"
# The Windows VM is on an image file with no disk dedicated to the VM. It gives decent performance.
# Please take your time to adjust the size for "lsw_windows_img_size" you can give to your image depending
# on the size you have on your only disk.
# Note: Looking Glass musts be installed because no 2nd keyboard and mouse are set.
# Adjust the variables with documentation/VARIABLES.md
