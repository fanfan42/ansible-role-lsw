Use this guide at your own risks. A wrong ROM may make your dGPU unable to work.

Only tested with **nvflash** and **bless** programs on Nvidia GTX cards.

A better guide will be created later, for now, install the packages given above and follow this [guide](https://gitlab.com/Mageas/single-gup-passthrough/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads#vbios-patching) -> "How to patch NVIDIA vBIOS".
