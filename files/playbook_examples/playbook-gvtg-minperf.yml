# The minperf playbook stands for "minimal performance"
# The Windows VM is on an image file with no disk dedicated to the VM. It gives decent performance.
# Please take your time to adjust the size for "lsw_windows_img_size" you can give to your image depending
# on the size you have on your only disk.
# lsw_windows_install_template is set to private mode for performance but less security and no Microsoft EULA support.
# lsw_windows_install_template set to private should only be used for private or educational purpose. Use at your own risks.
# You have to find the path of your lsw_config_usb_kbd and lsw_config_usb_mouse to have low latency on these devices.
# Note: Looking Glass musts be installed because it's a requirement for this virtualization mode.
# Adjust the variables with documentation/VARIABLES.md
